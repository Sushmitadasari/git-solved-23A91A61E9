## Branches
- main – Stable branch containing merged final code.  
- dev – Used for active development and testing.  
- conflict-simulator – Used to simulate merge conflicts for practice.  

---

## Git Operations Performed
- Created multiple branches and managed merges.  
- Simulated and manually resolved more than six merge conflicts in configuration and script files.  
- Used advanced Git commands:
  - `git stash` – temporarily saved uncommitted work.  
  - `git rebase` – maintained a linear commit history.  
  - `git cherry-pick` – selectively applied specific commits.  
  - `git revert` and `git reset` – safely rolled back changes when required.  
- Created annotated tags at major milestones (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0).  
- Maintained a detailed CHANGELOG.md with timestamps and reasoning for updates.  

---

## Commit and Tag Summary
- More than 20 commits across all branches.  
- Three major annotated tags created:  
  - v1.0 – Initial repository setup.  
  - v2.0 – Conflict resolution completed.  
  - v3.0 – Final documentation and cleanup.  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience with Git internals and conflict resolution.  
- Understood branch management in collaborative development.  
- Learned advanced Git commands for version control and recovery.  

---

## Final Status
- All conflicts resolved.  
- Clean working directory.  
- Organized and meaningful commit history.  
- Both origin and instructor remotes properly configured.  
- Documentation and changelog fully updated.
